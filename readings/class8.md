## CSS Layouts

### Controlling Positions of Elements
- Block level elements = h1 p ul li
#
Block level elements start a new line and are the outside box that contain inline elements. Header, paragraphs, unordered lists, and lists.

#
- Inline elements= img, b, i
#
Inside of the block level box go inline elements. 
#
- Containing elements = When a block element sits inside a block level the outside box is known as the parent element. It's a further step of being able to pin point what to change in css. 

#
### Positioning
- Normal flow = If no css is added the automatic layout that you see on the screen is normal flow. The base model of layout. 
- Relative positioning = This moves elements from normal flow. It doesn't affect surrounding elements.
- Absolute positioning = Taken out of normal flow and does not affect the surrounding elements. 
- Fixed Positioning = These do not affect surrounding elements and does not move when scrolling. 
- Floating = Floats and element from left to right; text flows around it.
- Overlapping elements = We can use Z - index to decide wich element sits on top of another element. 

#
### Screen Size
- Sometimes smaller devices have higher resolution than larger devices. The higher the resolution the smaller the text appear. 
- Page Size in px = 960-1000px is a good rule of thumb for a web page size. 
- Fixed Layout = Does not increase in size as user increases browser window. Cons: Gaps may appear around the edges of the screen; a user with a higher resolution screen may result in smaller text than intended by the designer.
- Liquid Layout = Increases in size as user increases browser window. Cons: design intended may differ as screen size is adjusted by user.

### CSS Frameworks
- Provides a template code of common tasks in  css. 

# 
### Multiple Style Sheets
- A way to organize css work is to create multiple style sheets for different areas in css.
- EX: One sheet for layout and another sheet for typography.
- Style sheets can be linked with @ import url
