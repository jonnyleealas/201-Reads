## Images
- To add an image into html we use an < img > element.
- We follow that by selecting the imgage using src=" "
- The image should be uploaded to a seperate folder created specificaly for the images of the page they are being used for.
- To help those with visual impairments add alt = " " with a discription of the image. 
- title= Can be used so a browser can display the content of the attribute when a user hovers over the image. 
- Height and Width can also be adjusted in the < img > link.
# 
Where you place the image is important. Where the text is in relation to the image is also important. Say the image is at the top left of the page and the words are difficult to read because they are to close to the image. You can add padding in bewteen the text and the image. 
You can also align text to any side of the page you can think of.
#
### 3 things to remember with img
- Save them in the right format.
- Right size. 
- Measure in pixels.
#
### Portrait vs Landscape
We can crop images in both of these, but which is best depends on the image. I think of it as a computure screen vs a phone screen. An image that needs more room vertically would work best in portrait. The opposite is true for portrait.
#
## CSS Color
#
- Rgb = red , green , blue
- Hex code= 6 digit num representing red, green, blue.
- Hue= Color circle.
- Saturation= Amount of grey represented in %.
- Lightness = Amount of white.
#

### CSS Text
Controling properties of text using CSS.
#
- Font = regular, bold, italic.
#
Typface are font styles, but must be installed in the computer using the typeface. They are subject to copyright. Also, keep in mind that the way a style looks on one comp may differ if using on another. Say mac vs pc. It is suggested to use no more than 3 types of typeface for a page.
# 
Font size can be adjusted using px, perctentage, and EMs. 
#
Where the text is aligned on the page can also be adjusted. Hovering, left, right, top, bottom.
