Objecte Literals

Objects are a place where you can story information for easy access.

### Things Like
- Names
- Age
- Color
# 
We can also add functions inside. When an function is held inside an object literal it is calle a **Method**. 
#
Anything added to an object literal needs to have a comma at the end except for the last item.
#
If an object needs to be used we can call it by first calling the objects name. Second the objects name is followed by a dot or period. Next to the dot we name the property we are calling inside the object literal.
#
### What are key values pairs in an object literal?
The key is the the name of the property. We use this to call the property. The value is... the value of the property. What it send out once its called.
### Document Object Model(Dom)
It is the browers representation of the page behind the scenes. We can change things in the page by going into the dom. You can also call elements with things like id or class.
###
- Document in the dom is the page in html.
- Dom is made up of a bunch of objects. 
- The model is how everything is layed out. In a tree.

### Nodes
Everything that we can affect with the dom is a node. Anything element we can call using a tag is a node. 
#
We can select elements in node by using 5 properties.
- Parent node 
- previousSibling 
- nextSibling
- FirstChild 
- lastChild

#
With the dom we can change just about anything on a page in the back end. Working in the dom is more efficient as well.
# 
From the dom we can add or remove html conent. We can change things according to their attributes by selecing their class or id. We can add lists. 

### Nodelist
A nodelist uses a forloop to go through a list of elements. This way we can apply the same code to muliple elements; a huge time saver.
